## 15 Days of LeetCode Challenge

This repository documents my **15-day streak of solving LeetCode problems**, focused on sharpening **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving discipline**.

### What I Practiced

- **Core Skills**: Arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, dynamic programming, greedy, and sliding window.
- **Languages**: Primarily **C++**, with select solutions in **Python**.
- **Patterns**: Binary search, two pointers, recursion/DFS/BFS, prefix/suffix techniques, and stack-based solutions.

### Structure

Each folder corresponds to a **LeetCode problem** and contains:
- **`<problem>.cpp` / `.py`**: My solution implementation.
- **`README.md`**: Brief notes or explanation for that problem.

### Consistency & Learning

- Solved at least **one problem per day for 15+ days**.
- Focused on writing **clean, readable code** and **documenting key ideas** per problem.
- Revisited classic problems (e.g., **Two Sum**, **Reverse Linked List**, **Maximum Subarray**, **Number of Islands**) to deepen understanding.

### Future Work

- **Extend the challenge** beyond 15 days (50/100-day streak).
- Add **time and space complexity** analysis to each problem.
- Implement **alternative approaches** (e.g., brute force vs optimized).
- Add **unit tests** and **performance benchmarks** for selected problems.
